# TalkGPT

## Introduction

ChatGPT has become a pivotal assistant enabling users to interact directly with data, facilitating text-based answers from natural language prompts and it recently included voice features for conversation. However, the web-version of ChatGPT does not incorporate the usage of audio for communication. This could prove to be challenging for users with reading or typing difficulties who would like to use the web version of ChatGPT.

One other notable concern for occasional users of ChatGPT is the necessity of a subscription plan to access the optimal version of ChatGPT (GPT-4). While the subscription plan offers substantial benefits for those interested in utilizing multiple plugins and maximizing ChatGPTâ€™s capabilities, it may not be as appealing to those who seek to query GPT-4 for information only occasionally.

Introducing TalkGPT, an app recently developed to address the challenges faced by occasional users who seek a remarkable experience with GPT-4 without a subscription, and who desire voice interaction capabilities. TalkGPT adopts a Pay-As-You-Go approach, inviting users to input an OpenAI API token for connection, subsequently billing them approximately $0.01 for every query sent to GPT-4. The app also employs an Automatic Speech Recognition model from Hugging Face ðŸ¤— for speech transcription and utilizes a Text-to-Speech model from Hugging Face ðŸ¤— to convert text into speech. These Hugging Face models are essential for voice communication.
